# WP01 import policy

Run the direct production-import check from the repository root:

```sh
scripts/check_internal_import_policy.sh
```

Run the deterministic policy fixtures before changing the rules:

```sh
scripts/check_internal_import_policy.sh --self-test
```

The script uses `go list` and checks only direct imports in the target domain,
HTTP, storage-provider, persistence, maintenance, and usage packages. It exits
with status 0 and prints a pass line when no forbidden edge exists. It exits
with status 1 and prints each `package -> import` edge when a forbidden import
is found. Provider children may import their cloud SDKs, and persistence
dialect children may import their SQL drivers; their other forbidden edges are
still checked. The testsupport prohibition applies to every production package
inspected, including packages not yet named by the architecture rules. A
`go list` or environment failure prints a diagnostic and exits nonzero before
evaluating policy edges.

WP01 intentionally leaves existing `internal/core`, `internal/common`,
`internal/models`, `internal/db`, and other legacy imports in place. The script
does not reject those imports until the later migration packages exist; this
keeps the characterization baseline useful and avoids turning WP01 into a
runtime or package-move change.

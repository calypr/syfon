# PR Summary: `feature/optimize`

## Overview

This branch is a broad optimization and cleanup pass across Syfon server runtime, generated API contracts, client/CLI behavior, storage and path handling, auth middleware, metrics, and reviewer-facing docs.

At a high level, the branch does five things at once:

1. restructures large runtime packages into smaller responsibility-focused files
2. improves object read/write and path-scoped behavior for project browsing and bulk operations
3. expands and corrects the internal bucket/project management API surface
4. modernizes client and CLI transfer behavior, auth flows, and package layout
5. updates code generation, docs, and CI/release plumbing to match the new surfaces

The raw diff is large, but a meaningful part of the size comes from generated API output and large package splits rather than entirely new product behavior.

## Main Themes

### 1) OpenAPI and generated API contract cleanup

The branch reorganizes `apigen` inputs and outputs so generation is clearer and closer to how the runtime actually serves specs:

- local OpenAPI specs move under `apigen/openapi`
- codegen configs move under `apigen/codegen`
- old `.openapi-generator` artifacts and stale generated model packages are removed
- generated DRS, bucket, and internal client/server packages are refreshed

This also adds the missing bucket-management generated surfaces for:

- deleting a bucket scope
- deleting all Syfon project data plus attached bucket scopes

The bucket client config now uses `response-type-suffix: Resp` so schema model names can coexist with `ClientWithResponses` wrapper names without producing invalid Go.

### 2) Internal API refactor by responsibility

Several oversized runtime packages are split into smaller units:

- `internal/api/drsapi`
  - split into `access.go`, `mutations.go`, `objects.go`, `registration.go`, `routes.go`
- `internal/api/internaldrs`
  - upload/download/data logic is reorganized around transfer, bucket helpers, and scoped route tests
- `internal/api/metrics`
  - old monolithic metrics routing is replaced with smaller focused files such as access, file usage, transfer ingest, and transfer reports
- `internal/api/middleware`
  - authn/authz and mode handling are reorganized into clearer local/gen3/token/plugin-specific files

This is largely maintainability work, but it changes enough routing and request handling code that reviewers should treat it as behavioral risk, not a mechanical move.

### 3) Auth and middleware semantics

The branch changes how Syfon reasons about authenticated access, especially in Gen3 mode:

- member/owner semantics are corrected in middleware checks
- the old authz cache is removed
- built-in and local authn modes are made more explicit
- JWT/session handling is expanded and better isolated
- CSV-backed local auth support is added

This area matters because it affects who is allowed to read, mutate, and enumerate scoped resources, especially around organization/project behavior.

### 4) Storage, scope, and object-model improvements

A large part of the branch improves how Syfon handles project-scoped objects and their backing storage:

- provider-aware bucket identity fixes duplicate-name issues across providers
- path fields are added and normalized more consistently
- bucket scope management is tightened
- project cleanup now deletes both Syfon objects and linked bucket scopes
- logic is added to remove bucket credentials when their last scope is removed
- object reads, object mutations, and storage deletion are separated into clearer core modules
- scoped browse/index behavior is improved for repo-style project views

This is the main product-level behavior bucket for the branch.

### 5) Index and browsing performance work

The branch includes multiple changes aimed at large-project browsing and bulk record access:

- indexing for path queries
- better scoped object selection and hydration paths
- support for project hierarchy/repo-style browsing improvements
- configurable or higher-value paging assumptions for large project views
- optimized bulk record fetching

Several supporting docs in this branch explain the intended behavior around:

- project hierarchy browsing
- configurable `/index` page sizing
- org/project storage metrics

### 6) Client and CLI restructuring

The client side is heavily reorganized:

- `client/conf` becomes `client/config`
- `client/syfonclient` becomes `client/services`
- `client/xfer` becomes `client/transfer`

This is not only a rename pass. The branch also adds or improves:

- cloud inspection helpers
- transfer retry and progress plumbing
- upload orchestration
- download engine behavior
- CLI auth support
- progress rendering
- command behavior for `upload`, `download`, `list`, `rm`, `metrics`, and related tests

Reviewers should expect both package-structure cleanup and end-user CLI behavior changes here.

### 7) Metrics surface changes

Metrics handling is significantly reworked:

- old generated metrics API artifacts are removed
- runtime metrics code is rewritten into smaller focused modules
- transfer-oriented metrics ingestion/reporting is added
- file usage and scope-aware metrics handling are expanded

This appears to be a shift away from one monolithic metrics route set toward narrower, composable metrics behaviors.

### 8) Documentation, deployment, and CI alignment

The branch also updates non-runtime surfaces so the new behavior is operable:

- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- MkDocs nav and multiple operator/problem-solution docs
- local deployment and Kubernetes deployment docs
- CI, docs, and release workflows
- dependency versions and CVE-related updates

This is important because the codegen and runtime changes would otherwise be difficult to operate or review correctly.

## Biggest Reviewer Buckets

If someone is reviewing this PR end to end, the highest-value buckets are:

### A) Runtime API behavior

Focus on:

- `internal/api/internaldrs`
- `internal/api/drsapi`
- `internal/api/middleware`
- `internal/api/metrics`

Questions to ask:

- did any route contract change silently?
- did auth checks become stricter or looser than intended?
- do new delete and scope behaviors match expectations?

### B) Storage and object correctness

Focus on:

- `internal/core`
- `internal/db/postgres`
- `internal/db/sqlite`
- `internal/common`

Questions to ask:

- are object IDs, paths, and scope boundaries canonicalized consistently?
- do provider-aware bucket identifiers avoid collisions without breaking older assumptions?
- are deletes and bulk operations scoped exactly to `{organization, project}`?

### C) Client and CLI compatibility

Focus on:

- `client/services`
- `client/transfer`
- `cmd/*`

Questions to ask:

- do the renamed/restructured packages preserve the same public behavior where required?
- do progress, retry, and auth changes preserve existing scripts and user workflows?
- are CLI tests covering the changed flows?

### D) Generated contract drift

Focus on:

- `apigen/openapi/*`
- `apigen/codegen/*`
- `apigen/client/*`
- `apigen/server/*`

Questions to ask:

- do generated diffs match actual intended API changes?
- are there any remaining name collisions or stale generated artifacts?
- does `make gen` now produce stable, compilable output?

## Suggested Reading Order

For a reviewer trying to get through the branch efficiently:

1. [operator-guide-code-generation.md](/Users/peterkor/Desktop/BMEG/syfon-complex/syfon/docs/operator-guide-code-generation.md)
2. [problem-solution-bucket-project-cleanup-codegen.md](/Users/peterkor/Desktop/BMEG/syfon-complex/syfon/docs/problem-solution-bucket-project-cleanup-codegen.md)
3. `internal/api/internaldrs`
4. `internal/api/middleware`
5. `internal/core`
6. `internal/db/postgres` and `internal/db/sqlite`
7. `client/services`, `client/transfer`, and `cmd/*`
8. generated `apigen` output last, after understanding the source OpenAPI and runtime intent

## Testing and Risk Notes

The branch carries risk in four areas:

- authz/authn regressions
- scoped delete behavior
- generated client/server contract drift
- CLI transfer regressions under real cloud providers

Testing focus should include:

- `make gen`
- `go build .`
- route-level tests in `internal/api/internaldrs`
- auth/middleware tests
- client transfer tests
- CLI tests for upload/download/list/remove flows

## Bottom Line

This is not one feature. It is a branch-wide optimization and reorganization pass that also ships real behavior changes in:

- bucket/project cleanup APIs
- auth middleware semantics
- path-scoped object handling
- transfer and CLI behavior
- metrics/reporting internals

The right way to review it is by subsystem, with generated output treated as a consequence of the OpenAPI and runtime changes rather than as the main event.
